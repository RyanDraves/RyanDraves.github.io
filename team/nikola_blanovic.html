    <h1 class="page-heading">About</h1>

    <p>My research focuses on understanding and modeling human behavior to support innovative information technology that will change how we study and design interactive user experiences. I envision modeling the human accurately across domains as a theoretical foundation for work in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in which computational models provide a foundation to study, describe, and understand complex human behaviors and support optimization and evaluation of user interfaces.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I work in domains of Computational Interaction, Behavior Data Analytics, and Human-Data Supported Interfaces to enable a future in which technology will automatically infer user goals, predict future user actions, describe common user behaviors, and even coach users. I create technology that automatically reasons about and acts in response to peopleâ€™s behavior to help them be productive, healthy, and safe.</p>
