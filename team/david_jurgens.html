    <h1 class="page-heading">About</h1>

    <p>I research how humans behave by observing the things we say, what we do, and who we are. My research combines linguistic analysis and network science together to understand behavior in its natural social context. I collaborate with colleagues from areas such as Psychology, Linguistics, Digital Humanities, and Sociology to improve our theories using data-driven insights and methodologies.</p>
