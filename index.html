  <h1 class="page-heading">Our Vision</h1>

  <p>Imagine falling in love or getting to know someone for the first time. The first conversation we have with someone is our chance to create an initial connection and see if we are a good fit. We trot out our best stories and questions to make a great first impression and avoid uncomfortable silence at all costs. After a few awkward exchanges, we share more personal details about ourselves, and the conversation grows in depth and significance. Wouldn’t it be interesting to have a bot that can interact with you on an intimate level? However, this task is challenging, as bots do not “see or feel the person” like humans do. Current social bots are replete with short scripts and dry statements that only deal with popular subjects such as movies, technology, and sports. We want to take it one level higher this time and design a social bot imbued with a personality.</p>
